## To-Do

- Make a generic connect command

### Protocol:

- Uncoople Perception and Decision loop (perceive intermediate state opponent combinaison for instance in Py421 Duo)
- Parrallelisation : Computation / Assimilate Perception (> bool last)


### New Games:

- Implements : **Connect4** and **Move**


### Cleanup:

- reprendre les Tutos
- Capture signals
- Tests HackaPy interprocess.
- Revise doc structure with section/directories.
- Complete Tutos and set a first clean version (WebPage), WebPage Doc with no subterfuge

### hackalib:

- c based hacka client/server lib.
- gamec421 hackalib version of 421 game.

### Revice Load and Dump:

- Add a first control line, with a encoding and list of Pod families.

```pod
txt 3 Board Cell Pod
0 0 0 0 3 :
1 0 3 2 1 : 1 1 2 1.0 4.0
2 4 1 0 0 : Army 10
1 0 3 2 0 : 2 2 3 3.0 2.0
1 0 3 2 0 : 3 3 1 4.0 1.0
```

- Add bit encoding


### Going Futher:

- Board cell with 2D geometry 2D (coordinates, shape/radius, ...)

- Reinforcement-Learning:
	* Sleep with last perception elements or wake-up with first game state ?
	* perception including trace (event based variable modification)
- Complete HackaGames Py421 state (i.e. horizon = 0 wen `keep-keep-keep`, and modify stateStr in Q-Learning tutorials).
- Complete Tutos and set a first clean version (WebPage), WebPage Doc with no subterfuge

- TicTacToe: Terminate the tutorial.
- Initialize a `log` function in games and players to put the things potentially silent.
- HackaLib - C lib + gameC421 exemple (game421 -> gamePy421).
- Change `local` to `start` or `play` and pootentially `start` to `server`. Attention to change the documentation as well.
- Look at PAIO-promo2022-grp-vert code and their python based viewer...
- Initialize a move game (no crach, MAPF) or something like that.
- larger dice game - the return of zombie game ?
- Integrate a Game Engine (gestion des collision, rendu graphique....): Option: (Best Box2d - godot)
	+ RayLib (Simple...)
	+ Godot - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godot_(game_engine)
	+ ClanLib - https://github.com/sphair/ClanLib
	+ Delta3D - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta3D
	+ ORX - https://orx-project.org/news/
	+ box2d.org
	+ FlatLand
	+ Cairo - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_%28graphics%29
- Integrate ShapeFile format.
