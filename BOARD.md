## To-Do

- Initialize a `log` function in games and players to put the things potentially silent.
- Change `local` to `start` or `play` and pootentially `start` to `server`. Attention to change the documentation as well.
- Look at PAIO-promo2022-grp-vert code and their python based viewer...
- Initialize a move game (no crach, MAPF) or something like that.
